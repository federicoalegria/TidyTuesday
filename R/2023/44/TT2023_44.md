## Horror Legends

For {tidytuesdayR} `tt_load(2023, week = 44)`, we were given some data from [Snopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snopes), a [fact-checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checking "Fact checking") website created by David and Barbara Mikkelson that has been described as a

> "well-regarded reference for sorting out myths and rumors" on the Internet. The site has also been seen as a source for both validating and [debunking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debunker "Debunker") [urban legends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_legend "Urban legend") and similar stories in [American popular culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States "Culture of the United States").

### Ratings

Here, we can spot how many of these have been rated as "Legend" & "True":

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

df |>
  group_by(rating) |>
  count(rating) |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = n,
    y = reorder(rating, desc(n)),
    fill = rating == "true"
  )) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           width = 0.65) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#444444",
                               "#fbd558")) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  labs(x = "counts",
       y = "",
       title = "spotting stories rated as true") +
  theme_clean(base_size = 14,
              base_family = "mono")
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

count01 <- df |>
  filter(rating == "true") |>
  summarise(count = length(rating))
```

`r glue("Truthful ratings sum {count01$count} events, and such folklore indicates our deepest fears in ways like these:")`

> ::: nonincremental
> -   We worry about the terrible accidents we're powerless to prevent, and we fear anonymous killers who choose victims at random.
> -   We cannot protect ourselves from the venomous animals who slither undetected into the places where we work, play, and shop, nor can we stop the onslaught of insects who invade our homes and our bodies.
> -   We're repulsed by the contaminants that may lurk in our food.
> -   We're afraid of foreigners and foreign places.

```{r}

count02 <- df |>
  filter(
    author == "Barbara Mikkelson" | author == "David Mikkelson",
    rating == "true"
  ) |> 
  summarise(count = length(rating))
```

Following an accountable logic, I decided to explore the stories about `accidents`, `killings`, `animals`, `poisonings`, `foreignness`, `threats`, `unknown` and `vanity` published at Snopes, but written by its founders; the Mikkelsons. This leaves a pool of `r glue(count02$count)` pieces:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

df |>
  filter(
    author == "Barbara Mikkelson" | author == "David Mikkelson",
    rating == "true"
  ) |>
  group_by(author, rating) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  adorn_totals(where = "row") |>
  knitr::kable()
```

`r glue("The following tag or word cloud, illustrates most frequent text data found in all titles from the {count02$count} instances rated as true by the Mikkelson couple:")`

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-overflow: wrap

## Let's read!

For a pleasant reading experience, we'll need a `*.txt` output

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| warning: false

sink(file = "/cloud/project/TT2023_44/output.txt")

df |>
  filter(
    author == "Barbara Mikkelson" |
      author == "David Mikkelson",
    rating == "legend" |
      rating == "true"
  ) |>
  select(author, rating, title, subtitle, claim) |>
  map(glimpse)

sink(file = NULL)
```

`output.txt` was cleaned in Sublime Text[^1] by using a "Find and Replace" method (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>H</kbd>) for double space strings where "∙∙" was found and replaced with a null character. Afterwards, it was imported as a \*.qda project in [QualCoder](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder) version [3.3](https://github.com/ccbogel/QualCoder/releases/tag/3.3).
