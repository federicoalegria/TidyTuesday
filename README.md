# TidyTuesday

This repository keeps my sporadic contributions to the [#TidyTuesday challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday), a weekly social data project focused on understanding how to summarise and arrange data to make meaningful and/or beautiful charts within the tidyverse (any other R packages) ecosystem. The project was founded in 2018 by [Thomas Mock](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/) and organized by the [R4DS online learning community](https://r4ds.io/join); a safe and supportive forum to practice data wrangling and visualisation skills.
