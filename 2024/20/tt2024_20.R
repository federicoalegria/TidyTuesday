## how should i interpret the following result?
##   
## Pearson's Chi-squared test
## 
## data:  df_sp$strength and df_sp$political_affiliation
## X-squared = 10.535, df = 6, p-value = 0.1039

# Communicate ----

# for tidytuesday 2024ยง20 
# i explored if there's any variation in coffee strength preferences'
# for different political affiliations. after shapeshifting caffeine
# preferments, there's a 10.39% probability that the observed differences in
# taste across different segments could have occurred by chance alone.
