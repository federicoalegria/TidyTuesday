------------------------------------------------------------------------

For {tidytuesdayR} `tt_load(2023, week = 51)`, we were given some data from the Internet Movie Database aka [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/). According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb), this database

> hosts information related to films, television series, podcasts, home videos, video games, and streaming content online; including cast, production crew and personal biographies, plot summaries, trivia, ratings, and fan and critical reviews.

Now, the main difference between the previous "[Holiday Movies](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2023/2023-12-12/readme.md)" dataset and this one is the cappability of contrasting a specific average from holiday related episodes with their broader average. You can check check out my previous data frolicking [here](https://github.com/federicoalegria/tidytuesday/tree/main/2023/50)!

### Fun Facts

-   "The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993) is the most voted holiday movie with 367,288 votes

-   'Bringing Back Christmas" (2023) is the movie with the highest average rating of 9.9

-   There's a Christmas movie about killer raccoons? ü¶ùüí•

### Quick Disclaimer

The two numeric variables containing average_rating and parent_average_rating got my attention right away. Nevertheless, the average rating can't be treated as a good sample due to its non-random nature...

## The Broad Picture

Despite that, we still can have some fun with it!

Typically, the independent variable gets plotted on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis. For this scenario, I recognised the average from the TV show or parent series as an independent variable. Logically, the holiday episode's rating should behave according to its parent series.

Despite the somewhat linear relationship we can see, the data-mass feels a bit heavy don't you think? Let's breakdown this massive thing into smaller pieces, like the **top 9 genres**!

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

# md table
he |>
  mutate(genres = str_replace(

  ) |>
  group_by(genres) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(n)) |> 
  filter(n >= 55) |> 
  filter(genres != "NA") |> 
  knitr::kable(
)
```

Now let's see how these genres behave:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

# facet wrapped scatter plot
he |>

  filter(
    genres %in% c(
      "Comedy",
      "Action",
      "Animation",
      "Adventure",
      "Drama",
      "Crime",
      "Reality-TV",
      "Documentary",
      "Family"
    )
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = parent_average_rating,
             y = average_rating)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.15) +
  geom_smooth(colour = '#000000',
              linewidth = 0.35) +
  facet_wrap( ~ genres) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "shows and episodes ratings",
    subtitle = "scatterplots mapping relationship between averages across genres",
    caption = "top genres alphabetically sorted
    geom_smooth's method by column = 'auto'
    tidytuesday 2023_51 [https://shorturl.at/csKS2]",
    x = "shows rating",
    y = "episode's rating") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(family = 'Consolas', size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(family = 'Consolas', size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(face = 'bold', family = 'Consolas', size = 15),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = 'plain', family = 'Consolas', size = 12),
    plot.caption = element_text(face = 'plain', family = 'Consolas')
)
```

Interesting...

## Diving Deeper into Genres

Have you ever heard of [Hull Plots](https://ggforce.data-imaginist.com/reference/geom_mark_hull.html)? This cool-looking geom is part of the {ggforce} package, and helps getting a clear definition of how scattered our data-points are.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

# broad hull plot

  mutate(genres = str_replace(genres, ",(.*)", "")) |>
  filter(
    genres %in% c(
      "Comedy",
      "Action",
      "Animation",
      "Adventure",
      "Drama",
      "Crime",
      "Reality-TV",
      "Documentary",
      "Family"
    )
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = parent_average_rating,
             y = average_rating)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.85) +
  geom_mark_hull(aes(fill = genres, label = genres),
                 concavity = 2.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_tq() +
  labs(
    title = "shows and episodes ratings",
    subtitle = "overlapped hullplots mapping the coverage of genres",
    caption = "tidytuesday 2023_51 [https://shorturl.at/csKS2]",
    x = "shows's rating",
    y = "episode's rating") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(family = 'Consolas', size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(family = 'Consolas', size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(face = 'bold', family = 'Consolas', size = 15),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(face = 'plain', family = 'Consolas', size = 12),
    plot.caption = element_text(face = 'plain', family = 'Consolas'),
    legend.position = 'none'
)
```

Jeez, it seems that genres are scattered all over the place! Let's spread them a bit:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

    genres %in% c(
      "Comedy",
      "Action",
      "Animation",
      "Adventure",
      "Drama",
      "Crime",
      "Reality-TV",
      "Documentary",
      "Family"
    )
  ) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = parent_average_rating,
             y = average_rating)) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.35) +
  geom_mark_hull(aes(fill = genres),
                 concavity = 2.8) +
  expand_limits(x = 10,
                y = 10) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_tq() +
  labs(
    title = "shows and episodes ratings",
    subtitle = "faceted hullplots mapping the coverage of each genre",
    caption = "tidytuesday 2023_51 [https://shorturl.at/csKS2]",
    x = "shows's rating",
    y = "episode's rating") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(family = 'Consolas', size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(family = 'Consolas', size = 10),
    plot.title = element_text(face = 'bold', family = 'Consolas', size = 15),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = 'Consolas', size = 12),
    plot.caption = element_text(family = 'Consolas'),
    legend.position = 'none'
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~ genres
)
```

Now, let's pick two of these for a better comparison!

I picked **Comedy** and **Reality-TV** for the following reasons:

-   they both appear to have a somewhat positive correlation

-   they seem as pretty different genres

-   their data-points are significantly different

However. the following comparisons won't be performed between them but in-between, that's the reason behind the disclaimer from above.

## Bring me that Comparison!

Perhaps the easiest and most simple way to compare two numeric variables is by computing their mean. However, outliers can potentially mess with this measurement so relying on the median could be a healthy call. Thanks to the wonders of the {ggplot}, we can see them both in the following notched box-plots:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true

    plot.subtitle = element_text(family = 'Consolas', size = 12),
    plot.caption = element_text(family = 'Consolas'),
    legend.position = 'none'
)
```

Did you notice the `pivot_longer()` function? This was necessary for graphing these plots. Also important for you to know, notches offer a rough guide to the significance of the difference between medians. When these don't overlap, we can interpret the visualisation as evidence of a statistically significant difference between the medians of the groups.

But we can't just rely on visual information!

Alright... But what does these results even mean?

The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test has a peculiar hypothesis scheme:

-   H0: The sample comes from a normally distributed population
-   H1: The sample does not come from a normally distributed population

In our case, we focused on the `parent_average_rating` for the reasons stated above.

For "Comedy", the p-value of `5.278e-05` doesn't allow us to conclude that the data comes from a normal distribution. However, thanks to the beauty of non-parametric tests, we can continue our analysis for the Comedy shows. Although, these type of tests are less robust than their parametric counterparts. Now, for the "Reality-TV" shows, things are reported differently; and with a p-value of `0.4916` the data appears to be consistent with a standard normal distribution.

## Correlation Tests

In a nutshell, correlation coefficients are statistical measures for assessing the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables; show and episode ratings for our case. Resulting coefficients will always range from -1 to 1. Here, an absolute value of "1" indicates a perfect degree of association and "0" means no linear relationship at all! The sign indicates the direction of the relationship; positive or negative. And as everything in inferential statistics, they come in parametric and non-parametric flavours.

### Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

he |>
  mutate(genres = str_replace(genres, ",(.*)", "")) |>
  filter(genres %in% c("Comedy")) %$%
  cor.test(parent_average_rating, 
           average_rating, 
           method = 'spearman')
```

The estimate of rho (œÅ) for these variables is `0.4344573`, which indicates a positive correlation between these variables; furthermore, the p-value is technically zero (`< 2.2e-16`). This means that the correlation we saw on the scatter-plots is very likely not due to chance. In other words, we could explain `43.44573%` of the average rating for holiday episodes in "Comedy" TV shows due to the grand average from the whole series to which these belong.

### Pearson's product-moment correlation

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: wrap
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| warning: false

he |>
  mutate(genres = str_replace(genres, ",(.*)", "")) |>
  filter(genres %in% c("Reality-TV")) %$%
  cor.test(parent_average_rating, 
           average_rating, 
           method = 'pearson')
```

In this case, the p-value of `4.852e-13` indicates that the correlation between the averages is highly significant. The correlation coefficient represents the range in which the true population correlation coefficient is likely to fall with 95 percent confidence; here `0.6108542 to 0.8325809`. In other words, we could explain `74.13123%` of the average rating for holiday episodes in "Reality-TV" shows due to the grand average from the whole series to which these belong.

## Checking the Models Performance

I also checked the models performance, but honestly I'm not too sure about what's going on here... So I took the liberty of asking [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) to give me a hand interpreting these results:

> The output provides various metrics to assess the performance of a linear regression model. Here's a brief interpretation of each metric.
>
> -   AIC (Akaike's Information Criterion): A measure of the model's relative quality, with lower values indicating a better fit while considering the model's complexity.
>
> -   AICc (Corrected Akaike's Information Criterion): A version of AIC that is adjusted for small sample sizes.
>
> -   BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion): Similar to AIC, BIC also measures the model's goodness of fit, but it penalizes model complexity more heavily.
>
> -   R-squared (R2): A measure of how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable, values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
>
> -   Adjusted R-squared (R2 adj.): A version of R-squared that accounts for the number of predictors in the model, often preferred when working with multiple independent variables.
>
> -   RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): A measure of the differences between predicted values and observed values, with lower values indicating a better fit.
>
> -   Sigma: The standard deviation of the errors in the regression model.

```{r}

he |>
  mutate(genres = str_replace(genres, ",(.*)", "")) |>
  filter(genres %in% c("Comedy")) %$%
  lm(parent_average_rating ~ average_rating) |> 
  model_performance()
```

So, low R-squared values, relatively low RMSE and Sigma, suggest a moderate fit of the model to the data.

¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
#| code-overflow: wrap

#| warning: false

he |>
  mutate(genres = str_replace(genres, ",(.*)", "")) |>
  filter(genres %in% c("Reality-TV")) %$%
  lm(parent_average_rating ~ average_rating) |> 
  model_performance()
```

In this specific output, the model has a relatively low AIC, AICc, and BIC, a moderate R-squared value of 0.55, and a relatively low RMSE and Sigma, indicating a reasonably good fit of the model to the data.
